## Original User Request:
I want to build a white-labeled parking management app for my brand using Firebase Studio. The app should allow customers to book and pay for parking spaces for trucks, trailers, and RVs, and be accessible as a web app and a mobile app downloadable on iOS and Android. Use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks), HTML, and CSS for the frontend, Firebase Functions for the backend, and Firebase Firestore to store bookings. Integrate Stripe for payment processing. The app should be branded with my company name, using a dark blue and white color scheme, and include a simple text-based logo placeholder. Provide instructions for deploying the web app and submitting the mobile app to app stores.

App Features:

User Interface (Frontend):
A homepage with a form to select a parking space type, booking dates, and duration.
Display available spaces and pricing.
A checkout page with a Stripe payment form.
A confirmation page showing the booking details.
Use vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the UI.
Apply white-label branding with my company name, a dark blue and white color scheme, and a text-based logo placeholder.
Ensure the design works for both web and mobile.
Backend (Firebase Functions):
Create API endpoints using Firebase Functions to:
Check available parking spaces based on date and space type.
Create a booking (store customer details, dates, space type, price).
Process payments via Stripe.
Use Firebase Firestore to store bookings (fields: booking ID, customer name, email, space type, dates, price, payment status).
Secure the API with Firebase Authentication (optional, for customer accounts).
Stripe Integration:
Integrate Stripe to process payments securely when a customer checks out.
Ensure payments are recorded and paid out to my Stripe account.
Deployment:
Instructions to deploy the web app using Firebase Hosting.
Instructions to compile the app for iOS and Android in Firebase Studio and submit it to the App Store and Google Play, branded with my company name.
Project Structure:

Create a project with folders: public (for HTML, CSS, vanilla JS), functions (for Firebase Functions), and Firestore rules.
Include a README.md with setup, deployment, and app store submission instructions.
Steps to Generate:

Set up the Firebase Studio project with Firebase Hosting, Firestore, Functions, and Authentication.
Create the Firestore schema for bookings.
Build the frontend UI with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (homepage, booking form, checkout, confirmation page).
Build the backend API with Firebase Functions (endpoints for availability, booking, payment).
Integrate Stripe for payments.
Add white-label branding (company name, dark blue/white theme).
Provide deployment instructions for web and mobile.
Additional Notes:

Use environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., Stripe API keys).

Ensure the app is secure (e.g., validate inputs, secure API endpoints).
Provide sample data for parking spaces (e.g., 10 spaces for trucks/RVs at a set price per day).
